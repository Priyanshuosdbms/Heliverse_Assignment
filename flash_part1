Basics of Flash Memory

The lecture covers four main aspects of flash memory: NAND and NOR architectures, programming and erasing flash memory cells, data retention and endurance, and multi-level flash [05:20].
NAND vs. NOR Architectures

In NOR architecture, each cell can be individually addressed using bit lines and word lines [06:05].
NAND architecture connects cells in series, requiring all other cells to be turned on to access a specific cell [06:32].
NAND is more compact (5F² feature size) compared to NOR (10F²) [07:00].
NOR offers faster read times (tens of nanoseconds) compared to NAND (few microseconds) [07:42].
The terms NAND and NOR are derived from their resemblance to NAND and NOR gate circuit diagrams [09:02].
NAND's compact design results in lower costs, driving its market growth [11:03].
How Flash Memory Works

Flash memory traps charge in the gate stack to shift the threshold voltage [11:46].
A floating gate, separated from the channel by a tunnel oxide, stores charge [12:57].
The presence or absence of charge determines the current flow, allowing the cell to be read [14:12].
High positive or negative voltage is applied to the control gate to program or erase the cell [15:02].
Reading speed in NAND is limited by the need to turn on neighboring cells [15:45].
The relationship between floating gate voltage, control gate voltage, and stored charge is crucial for cell operation [17:12].
Tunneling Phenomena

Tunneling is essential for programming and erasing flash memory [19:13].
Different tunneling regimes include direct tunneling (lower voltage) and Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling (high voltage) [19:29].
Programming uses FN tunneling (high voltage), while data retention relies on minimal tunneling [20:44].

Band Diagram and Cell Programming/Erasing: The video starts by explaining how the band diagram looks, with two dielectrics: a thinner tunnel dielectric and a thicker inter-poly or blocking dielectric [00:06]. Programming a cell involves applying a high voltage, resulting in a large tunnel current in and a smaller current out [00:23]. Erasing the cell involves applying a negative voltage, which removes electrons from the floating gate [00:48].
Threshold Voltage and Program Window: The charge builds up over time with a fixed gate voltage, achieving either a high or negative threshold voltage (VT) depending on whether the cell is being programmed or erased [01:34]. The difference between the programmed and erased VT is the total program window [01:54].
Dielectric Materials and Retention: The top dielectric (IPD) can be a single layer of oxide or a multi-layer structure, typically ONO (oxide-nitride-oxide) [02:54]. Nitride has a higher dielectric constant than oxide, which is why ONO is used [03:08]. When the voltage is removed after programming, the negative charge develops a negative voltage on the floating gate, and the goal is to retain the cell state [03:22].
Endurance and Cycling: Flash memory endurance refers to how many times a cell can be read and written [05:09]. Over time, with repeated cycling (programming and erasing), the program window starts to close [05:16]. This is due to trapped electrons in the tunnel dielectric, which raises the erase VT and lowers the program state [05:30].
Stress-Induced Leakage Current (SILC): Repeated tunneling of current in and out of the device leads to stress-induced leakage current [06:40]. Multiple traps form, creating tunneling paths and increasing current in the low-voltage state, which limits retention time [06:47].
Multi-Level Cell (MLC) Operation: Instead of storing just one bit, MLC stores multiple bits by having multiple levels within the threshold voltage window [08:45]. For example, two bits require four levels, and three bits (TLC) require eight levels [09:39]. MLC increases storage capacity but decreases the signal-to-noise ratio and makes it harder to separate cells, especially after cycling [10:33].
Electron Storage and Technology Nodes: In 1997, the first MLC product stored around 30,000 electrons between the program and erase states, with each level corresponding to about 3,000 electrons [11:02]. At a 20-nanometer node, only about 500 electrons are stored in total, with approximately 10 electrons per state [12:46].
Trade-offs with MLC: While MLC increases storage density, it comes with trade-offs [13:44]. The number of program/erase cycles decreases significantly (e.g., from 100k times for single-level cells to 10k or fewer times for MLC) [13:53]. Retention is poorer (one year instead of ten), and the process is slower, requiring more error correction bits [14:19].
Current Technology and Error Correction: Companies are using a mix of single, multi, and triple-level cells with algorithms to achieve faster overall systems at a low price [15:04].

Visualizing NAND Flash Memory - The video begins by showing a TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) image of a NAND flash memory chip, resembling a skyline of skyscraper-like cells [00:25]. Each of these cells represents a NAND memory cell, consisting of silicon, shallow trench isolation (STI), a floating gate for charge storage, tunnel oxide, blocking oxide, and a control gate [01:05].
Limitations of Scaling Down 2D NAND - Traditionally, the cost per bit of NAND flash memory was reduced by scaling down the size of individual cells [02:25]. However, this approach is losing steam due to the limitations in scaling the tunnel oxide [02:41]. The tunnel oxide regulates electron flow, and scaling it down compromises the cell's retention [04:36].
Challenges of Horizontal Scaling - While vertical scaling is limited, horizontal scaling poses its own challenges [06:26]. As horizontal dimensions decrease, the floating gate volume reduces, leading to cell-to-cell variations and making it difficult to store multiple bits per cell [06:54]. Additionally, the increasing cell-to-cell capacitance due to limited space for the control gate to wrap around the floating gate further restricts horizontal scaling [08:17].
Cost of Lithography - The increasing complexity and cost of lithography steps required for scaling horizontal cell dimensions also contribute to the need for 3D NAND [09:22]. Despite the consistent decrease in cost per bit of NAND flash memory, the rising expenses associated with advanced lithography techniques threaten to reverse this trend [11:31].
3D NAND as a Solution - 3D NAND technology offers a solution by determining cell dimensions through layer deposition rather than lithography [12:04]. This approach reduces costs and allows for controlling the cell cost by increasing the number of layers [13:32].
3D NAND Array - The video concludes by showing a 3D NAND flash array, where control gates are determined by deposition steps, and the spacing between cells is determined by the thickness of deposited layers [14:13].

Invention and Evolution: Flash memory was invented in 1984 by Fujio Masuoka from Toshiba [00:49]. The technology evolved from requiring UV light for erasing to electrical signals for programming and erasing [00:33], leading to increased density and the development of NAND architecture [01:22].
Multi-Level Cells (MLC): In 1997, the introduction of MLC allowed for storing more bits per cell, significantly increasing memory capacity [03:20].
Huang's Law: From 2002 to 2010, flash memory capacity doubled every year, a phenomenon known as Huang's Law [03:54]. This surpassed Moore's Law, driven by the demands of post-PC devices [04:02].
Manufacturing Process: The manufacturing process involves patterning bit lines and word lines [09:13]. Double patterning techniques have been used since 2007 [06:56]. NAND chips often consist of multiple dies stacked together [07:35].
Area Efficiency: NAND flash memory has a high area efficiency, with over 80% of the die area dedicated to memory cells [08:37].
Word Line Wrapping: Word lines wrap around bit lines to maximize gate coupling ratio and increase capacitance [12:00].
Technology Advancement: Flash memory technology has advanced rapidly, exceeding predictions from the mid-2000s [13:44]. NAND flash has driven advancements in lithography, including the use of double and quadruple patterning [15:13].
Feature Size: The reported feature size of 19 nanometers refers to the separation between word lines, while the separation between bit lines is larger [15:50].
